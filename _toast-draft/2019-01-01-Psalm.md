# Psalm
**By Mark Sanders**

The orchard blooms smell—peaches, nectarines,  
apricots.  Lanes between trees, gray  
and amber-tearful, molten underfoot with the pit and fallen.  

Yet good abundance:  wasps and bees, wash in buzz,  
wind—the immersion under which the man   
dissolves and softens.  

If death be like this, death be like this.  
Venture green and orange, hued brown.  Oak shadows,  
modest mumbling, like angels humming.    

Bewilderments be bedeviled—trucks along  
Farm road curves downshifting like life  
gone too fast, horses’ scoffing and huffing,  

the this and that in thousand-birded sky—  
do not look up, the opening heaven homeward  
is not there.  Gaze and remembrance    

be the table bare, breeze in the table cloth  
beating the feast in heart, ghost in the cup   
from which I drink, intoxicating.
