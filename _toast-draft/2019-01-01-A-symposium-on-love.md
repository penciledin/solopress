# A Symposium on Love
**By Hilda Raz**

*‘Damn the word,’ said Justine once, ‘I would like to spell it backwards as you say the Elizabethans did God. Call it evol and make it a part of “evolution” or “revolt.”* – Justine, Lawrence Durrell

Age is an evolution – or devolution – of lust.  
To be lost in revolt, as one must be growing up,  
invites erotics into the palace of the family.  
Air spiked with ecstasy. We all know it.  
Then voluble in bed might signify lust  
or politics, depending on whether  
you live in a hovel, where the velocity  
of wildlife about its vital business  
shadows the movements of governments,  

or a hotel, hovering over the chasm  
between mountains, where we stopped.  
Olives. Lupine. The sound of viols  
through the balcony window, resinous,  
heard through steam: treatments for the liver.  
Into the porches of our ears pours music  
attenuated by marble spaces. “That old man  
wants to live,” whispers a medic,  
mopping up. His vulpine mask a blur  
through silk curtains as he bends over  
to lave bodies slippery with oil. He cares for us.  

Here, in the mountains, where we feel free,  
olives are served in gin straight from the freezer.  
The menu reports that olev is an alternative,  
a citrus fruit found in the garden below.  
A solo viola plays at a wedding on the patio.  

Is olev a word in another language,  
an oval fruit used in a harvest ritual,  
a kind of citron, a renewal, a stand-in for love?  

Maybe instead you wrote, “Nearby some wedding party is tuning up.  
It’s hard to hear their voices. We’ve enough lunacy on this balcony  
overlooking the ceremony to interpret youth and age. Drink up!”  
She whispers, “I’ve loved you for half my life.”  

To reprise: voluble in bed can signify  
the exhaustion of lust and the birth of politics  
depending on where you live, a hovel,  
or next summer’s hotel on a coast, where olives are eaten  
crushed with oil and tomatoes on pasta. Viols can be heard  
from a balcony overlooking the river.  
In a hotel notebook become a diary you can signify a place  
where you stayed one summer, the air an oven  
you entered to make love or sleep.  
Your bed linens were streaked with damp.  
Remember oval windows above his elbow,  
trimmed with red and yellow light? I don’t.  

A mirror in the corner showed us at the moment  
we became another person, tiny and contorted  
for a few beats, who might change into  
an idiot with a harelip, or a midget,  
a violinist of genius but peculiar, hard to reach  
until the world called out to him and he went.  
He appears tonight on the program.  

Let us return to the moment, please. Take out your pencils.  
Your new partner is to be found at the next table,  
voluble, thank God, after months of silence.  
What’s he onto now? Oh, the volume of trade  
on the stock exchange. I’m interested. Are you?  

Here, in the mountains, after sunburnt children with their dogs  
are put to bed, conversation veers toward the intimate.  
Of course the subject is money. A plunging market.  
What’s to be done? Be patient. The people will speak.  
Vox Popular in November. The new white may be black.  
Be patient. “I grew up in a Victorian melodrama,” overheard,  
might seem to change the stakes. For me, at least.  

In a corner of the room, under satin swags  
that frame the mountains, three women lean  
toward the axis of their table and whisper.  
You can barely hear their hisses over the swipe  
of VISA through the bar machine.  
*If you... you’ll disappear... Escape?*  
But how? Where do they think they’ll go?  

Imagine nobody knows your history, race,  
time or place, the revolting details of divorce,  
custody – wait, isn’t that word custard?  
Famous dish everyone who comes near craves?  
Revenge is a dish best served cold, embellished  
with sugar icing in the shape of a crown.  
Never. We don’t do *that* in this country.  

Meanwhile the elderly are falling in love.  
You can. Erotic is the reverse of deathly.  
Dour Mr. Thanatos rents out accordions  
at base camp if you’ve a mind to dance.  

And while we’re speculating here, at 8,000 feet,  
if you have a comrade with a mind so rigid  
you can hear the crack on the page as you read  
his work, what can you do?  

Maybe you can write some evolved and looser squiggles  
to depict the guy on the plane en route, in the next seat,  
depressed because no one will talk to him  
so his head droops onto his chest  
seemingly ready to be released into a basket.  
Wasn’t that the French Revolution?  
That guy only wanted to convert us, not seduce.  

Nearby some wedding party is tuning up.  
It’s hard to hear over his voice what they’re saying.  
Certainly we’ve enough lunacy on this balcony  
overlooking the pool. Drink up!  
A bridesmaid hands over a hanky. The best man is a her.  
Their fathers link arms. Their mothers smile.  
By now we’re sobbing into tissues and taking pictures.  

Next comes midlife revolt. What do you think?  
Oh look. A moose lopes over the top of the mountain.  
You know, I’ve loved him for half my life.  
At the end, it seems, the rest of the relatives died.
