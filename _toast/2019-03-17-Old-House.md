  This is the last release of Toast, and we’re ending it on a poem of transformation. Thank you for reading, sharing and reaching out. This has been an absolute honor to work with Solo Press to bring these poems to you. Please consider getting a copy of *Solo Novo 5/6*, which will include all poems from *Toast* and more. We are sending it to the printer this week, so it should be ready within a week or two.

## Old House (Homage to Larkin)

Home was cramped,  
its walls painted  
the pale blue   
of disappointment.  
The disarray so alarming  
you could count on it.  
Anxieties piled so high  
you could sweep them up   
everyday,  
with plenty left  
to go around.

I swept, I waited.  
I grew long hair,  
small breasts.  
Wore black tights and read   
Ginsberg & Donne.  
I marched & searched  
for sex.  
I grew, I swept, I waited.  
Then left.    
I was done.
