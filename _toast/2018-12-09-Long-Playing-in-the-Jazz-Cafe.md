**Long Playing in the Jazz Café**

Smooth moves   
the instruments gyrate   
on the wall where invisible   
the man plays his bass.  

The waiters  
float around the notes  
of the tourists  
who don’t know  
the ways of rum.  

The frozen smiles  
beating like drums,  
eyeing hips and butts  
to goose in Havana.  

They tip back their drinks  
to play in the Jazz Café  
with a girl on each arm  
dreaming inside the curved glass,  
two faces long playing  
simultaneous gyrations  
balancing the needle of Cuba.  

Voices accompanied   
by the headless quartet  
speak softly the words:  
*It had to be you,  
Nobody but you.*
