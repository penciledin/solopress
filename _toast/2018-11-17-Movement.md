  In those moments when I am most restless, when my knees keep bouncing and my thoughts flit about, nothing is wrong. In fact — according to Marguerite Costigan — everything is as it should be. I can be at peace with my restlessness.

## Movement
**by Marguerite Costigan**  

We who *can* move, *must* move.  
We are not planted  
like trees, only our leaves astir, like hair  
flung into oceans of air;  
only our branch-tips bending in the slow  
shifting of time and light.  
We are not anchored like mountains,   
feeling only  
the split and peel of our stony skins,  
sloughed off by gravity  
downslope, downhill, into  
buried rubble and scree.

We are not founded on stone  
like buildings or monuments, like  
the Great Ideas mapped-out in minds,  
like Nations, like Mathematics,   
like laws and dogma,  
like vows and promises.

Yet look, close-in,  
at the wavering rims, the edges,  
the orbiting cores  
of all these things:  
We are speeding and they are slow,  
but we all are moving, *moving* –  
we all must move, to feel, to know,  
to be in Time at all  
we must move, *move,*  
to continue into being.
