  Family histories are — like life itself — complicated. Tragedy and strength intermingle in this one.

**Leila Said Gutowski**
## Poking Holes in Despair

**I.  Tante Luschi, my Oma's favorite Aunt**  

Tante Luschi the Viennese Dame  
was just Jewish enough.  
When the train horn  
sounded the name Auschwitz,  
she ate her last cherries.  

Later she was found on the ground,  
the stove's gas pipe in her hand,  
a smile on the lipsticked lips  
of her silk-stockinged body;  
The last bites of pastry  
dried on a plate.  

**II.  The Aunt from Iraq**  

She was a refugee  
allowed one suitcase  
and one hand free  
across the border.  

There in the rows of assigned mats,  
where no one cared  
that she could trace  
the family line  
direct to the Prophet,  
she took her wedding sheets out,  
still smelling of pre-war laundry,  
unfolded and smoothed them  
with her brown, gold-banded hand.  

She pinned the foto of her husband  
on the one-half of the pillow;  
his body was left behind near the family home,  
In the Nineveh mounds.  

That nobility, that Sharifa then laid down,  
facing his empty space and into the future  
not knowing where on God's cue  
her next home would be.
