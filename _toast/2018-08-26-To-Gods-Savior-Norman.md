  It’s odd how much someone’s life changes after they die. When my father passed, my family told stories of a different man than the one I knew. Even the memorial service didn’t really fit him. It was more for those of us still here.

## To God’s Savior, Norman
*by Adele Maze*

(I didn’t see my father much  
but I went to his funeral.  
It was formulaic,  
in a church he never attended.  
My sisters and I walked in  
as strangers.  
We were given a card  
with a picture of Jesus  
eyes rolled upward  
crown of thorns  
and the words,  
like puncture wounds  
and ridiculous at once,  
“God’s Savior, Norman”)  

Love was minuscule  
a rarity.  
I spent my childhood  
sitting next to you,  
mutilated mealtimes,  
lacking flavor.  
I welcomed disturbance.  
I was the clown.  
I wanted you  
to put down the steak knife,  
look up from your plate.  
Heart remote  
in a hedged off courtyard.  

“Ask me about my day”   
disintegrated.  
You missed the three stone steps  
to the highest terrace,  
the view  
where everything contributes.
