  Each rotation around the sun I vow the same thing: “this is the year I chart my own course. This time it will be different.” But I’m already different, by the very nature of time. Maybe this will be the year I am comfortable with myself.

## New Constellations

The past’s invisible signpost  
casts a crook shadow.  
I’ve done the lost-scout-in-the woods  
comes-full-circle-round  
more than once  
back to that jagged stile.  

I paint the post blue  
with gold letters that point  
to tomorrow and  
plant a sweet potato vine  
for the bees to find honey.  
When a bit of gold slops  
on my overalls,  
I make up names  
for new constellations.
