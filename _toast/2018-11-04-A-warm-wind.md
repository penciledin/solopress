  When I focus on my breath, it’s not always peaceful. Instead of everything falling away, sometimes all my thoughts rise up and begin a revolution. When I am in those moments, I feel somewhat like Kobus Moolman here. Kobus was the 2015 winner of the [Glenna Luschei African American Award](http://africanpoetrybf.unl.edu/?page_id=2058#glenna) for his collection *Book of Rooms*.

notes:
  Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky. Conscious breathing is my anchor.

## A warm wind...
**by Kobus Moolman**  

A warm wind brings up the smell of wet hair from within his blood.  
The smell of door handles and sheets.  
The smell of sleepless walls and passages with hands.  
      The wind is twenty fingers folding soft flesh.  
      The wind is four eyes copying an eclipse of the moon.  
      The wind is the smell of remembering   
            beneath his naked skin.
