  Lately I have been at odds with the notion of reverie, of being "lost in thought." I don't ever want to be lost! But perhaps mindfulness and reverie don't need to oppose each other.

  In this poem by Naomi Shihab Nye one state leads to the other, and each is equally important. Both connect her to herself, to her family, to perseverance.  

  Wherever you are, friend, persevere. In these trying times, persevere.

notes:
  It is too easy to take the beauty of each moment for granted. This poem by Naomi Shihab Nye moves back and forth through time effortlessly, allowing memory to inform the now. Nye currently lives in San Antonio, Texas.
  Reveries are a strange and wondrous product of our attention. Sometimes I'm as entranced by the details of this moment as I'm swept away by the memory of another time. Here, Naomi Shihab Nie takes us with her as this moment transports her to another.
  Mindfulness and reverie are usually at odds with each other. Yet here is a poem by Naomi Shihab Nye where one leads to the other.

## Help

I had not noticed  
the many-petalled yellow flower  
   strikingly thin petals  
like a man with many hopes  
or a woman with many dreams  
and the center almost a tiny hive  
ants could crawl in and out of  
   if they wanted to  

Had not noticed the profusion  
   on the path to the coffee pot  

Had not stopped, stooped  
   to absorb the glory of  
      many-petalled yellow  

or remembered the freshness  
of my father's collar  
   for some years now  
rush of anticipation  
   circling his morning self  
despite so much ruined history  
      and searing news  

Who can help us?  
   yellow beam  
      spiral sunshine  
         Legacy
