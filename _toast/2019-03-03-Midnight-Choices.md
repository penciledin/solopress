  I am sad to announce that there will be only two more installments of Toast after this one. Thank you for being with us on this journey. We’ll have more to announce soon.

  Good horror stories always leave you unsettled, but more than that they reflect sincere human flaws and frailties. This one, by Kathryn Ridall, is among the best.

**Kathryn Ridall**
## Midnight Choices

I startled awake and she was there  
  crouched in the corner of my room,  

hair yellow and frizzed  
  her eyes hungry crows.  

One mole rose from her chin  
  like a dab of tar.  

I was three, her cackle echoed  
  with black intent.  

Small twitching girl  
  I scanned my choices,  

slid bare feet to the floor  
  and crept toward mother’s bed,  

a place already known,  
  cold as ice.
