  Of everything written about love, lately I’ve been most interested in its long game. The slow simmer of a stew on the stove. Here’s one by Mark Sanders, truth and care in equal measure.

# The Horse as the Letter L

Love moves like something righteous and eternal   
enveloped in summer’s blanche, air crackling  
once sun recedes, and the sky ribboned  
is a window pane a shot has pierced, the hole  
the horse, that perfect circle of animal fenced by lightning  
and the pasture is the thunder of ordinances that summon rain.  

Love is that patient creature, wind tearing the mane  
and tail, crepe fabric, and the strands are motion and evidence   
the foundation and fortress of flesh stands firm.  
   Let dirt or sleet welt the horse,   
it does not imagine other places, the high spot where a river valley winds  
through blind cliffs nor deep wet meadows where it wades,   
nor does it remember shale slipping along slopes, when last it fell   

and had to lift its bulk, the bit pinching its mouth.  It looks forward, always,  
at the grass before it, toward the noise it may hear.  
It will carry the burden, the clumsy rider; it will trod  
warily the stony switchback or woods where what is wild hides  
and waits, cleave the tall thick, breeze-bent reeds  
as if parting a creek’s current.    
Let there always be a horse  
to clarify the landscape of love, being what it is and nothing more,  
true as oak, true as birds that lift and fall and sing  
the one song they know by rote, it does not need to be pronounced  
but is.
