  Friday Gretchen’s description of physical domestic abuse is clinical in a way, mirroring her detachment from the event. This echoes my own history as a victim of abuse. If you are in a situation like this, you are not alone. [This link](https://helpguide.org/articles/abuse/domestic-violence-and-abuse.htm) is a good place to start for identifying the signs of an abusive relationship, and where to seek help.

## A Watched Pot Does Boil
**by Friday Gretchen**  

Darkness eclipses his soft brown eyes  
while a deep furrow fractures his brow  
Here I stand motionless as prey detecting danger  

I wonder if the rage starts at his toes,  
how water begins to boil at the base of a pot  
Rising into him like wisps from hot asphalt  
Up through his mid-section, spreading  
to heavy fingers becoming fists, face reddening,   
in the night golden light of our kitchen   

Closing in, his brick hands swollen  
like ticks forewarn me  
Eyes growling, his mouth articulates fury  
but I hear only an electrical buzz   
over spastic thumps of my own heart  

Swiftly, my head spins down to tile,   
my limp body follows, and rests there  

Later, he returns with tear-soaked cheeks,   
wanting only to be held and forgiven —  
He kneels beside my crumpled form and sweeps   
a stray lock of hair behind my bloodied ear.
