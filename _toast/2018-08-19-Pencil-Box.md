  My son said his first day of kindergarten was “the best day ever,” mostly because “they didn’t make me take a nap!” He is easing into the pleasure of carrying around a zippered pencil pouch. Perhaps soon he will appreciate them as Kelli Grinich does in today’s poem.

## Pencil Box
*by Kelli Grinich*

Scholastic Ticonderoga No. 2's  
and rainbow of soft-cored colored pencils.  
Smell of wood and graphite and mineral wax  
points worn to the round of old mountains  
moth-wing shavings trimmed in yellow paint.  

One hexagonal pencil fattened with duct tape   
for better grip   
during the broken finger weeks.  
Another two-inch stub with  
eraser rubbed flat to brass circle rim.  

What stories came before these remnants,  
their courage bolstered by  
pencil-eraser forgiveness?  
Make gone and begin again.  

Amid the colors  
Copenhagen, Peacock, True Blue  
pigments ran off to skies and oceans and lakes.  
Carmine and Crimson bound together with   
rubber bands, two-tone ghosts of Valentine's Day hearts  
or apples on branches   
growing from Sienna Brown trunks.  

Goldenrod sharpened to half-length  
took life in blonde curls   
self-portrait of the eight-year-old   
still taped   
to the laundry room wall.
