  For much of my life, writing has been an act of defiance against a world that doesn’t always listen. Here’s one from Kym Sites, as much a truth as it is a warning.

notes:
  Where does the self end and the crowd start?
  Know that despite evidence to the contrary — if you speak trust you will be heard. And more importantly, if you can listen for that more than you speak, the truth Kym Sites writes about may go away.
  It’s odd writing an introduction that is longer than the piece itself.
  For much of my life, writing has been an act of defiance against a world that doesn’t always listen. Here’s one from Kym Sites. I suppose the best way to fight this truth is to listen ourselves.

## A Truth
*by Kym Sites*

The crowd like quick sand  
Quiets the dissonant voice.  
No evidence left behind.
