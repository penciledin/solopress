  Lev Grossman said in his essay [*Benedictus: Thoughts on Being a Writer and Having Children*](https://web.archive.org/web/20160808085408/http://levgrossman.com/2012/09/benedict/) (hat tip to [Austin Kleon](http://tumblr.austinkleon.com/post/31688329484)):

  “I think of children sort of like Voyager probes, except instead of sending them out into space you send them forward in time. They carry messages from your civilization inside them, on into the weirdness of the future.”

  Here's one by Ivan BrownOtter, and it’s for the teachers and the children. It’s for you, too; you who have stories yearning to be told.

## Swirling Stardust into the Universe

For writing class  
I have an old olive jar full of   
blue-curved commas  
rosy-pink periods   
and silvery-semicolons  
for children to shape their stories		  

The kids pour the punctuation marks		  	
into their cupped hands					  
but instead of putting the marks 		  	
in all the right places						
they sprinkle them across their pages		   		
like the Great Spirit 						  
swirling stardust into the Universe			  	

With a fanciful sense of well done       
the kids turn in their stories  
eager to tell their tales  
always finishing with  
big capital letters  

THE END
