  When I honestly take stock of my life, I'm sometimes at a loss: what I should do with all I've unpacked? The pain, the shame, the missed opportunities… Here's one by George Burns. He’s right there with me.

## What if rusted
**by George Burns**

What if stripped  
Stripped and rusted  
What if stripped rusted  
       and stained  
What if mother  
       rusted stripped and stained	  

Where would I begin  
What if my throat rusted  
What if, where would I begin  
       stripped  
       stained  
       mother  

What if  some polish somewhere  
       begins to unstain  
with some polish somewhere  
What then would I paint  
       the stained shell   
       white or pink  
       leave it   
Stained  

Oh mother why did you  
What if we could   
       wrap the rust  
       in a shell of rose stain  

Why did we  
What if  
Should we just leave it  
       Stripped
