description: My son turned five last month. I’m still five, too. Still five, seventeen, twenty eight and many other numbers. Here's one by Brian Landis — it feels like a photo album as much as a poem.
notes:
  It's summer again, a time of warmth and laughter. This poem by Brian Landis is a reminder that every beginning is just another moment in transit.
  With every passing year, I realize I'm changing in ways I could never have predicted. Some of it is gradual, some of it as abrupt as a car accident.
  This poem reminds me that some of the things that define me are sudden, but most of these changes have really been there all along.
  My son doesn’t think it’s cute when I tell him I'm five just like him.

## In The Canyon

All these travels  
All of these trails and glories  
it's just as if nothing  
had ever happened  
All there ever was... remains.  

I went in one end of the canyon  
and came out the other.
