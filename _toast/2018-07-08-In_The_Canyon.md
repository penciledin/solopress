description: My son turned five last month. I’m still five, too. Still five, seventeen, twenty eight and many other numbers. Here's one by Brian Landis — it feels like a photo album as much as a poem.

## In The Canyon

All these travels  
All of these trails and glories  
it's just as if nothing  
had ever happened  
All there ever was... remains.  

I went in one end of the canyon  
and came out the other.
