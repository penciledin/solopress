  When I was sixteen, and even at twenty-six, I had no idea the possibilities within my grasp. I’m sure ten years from now, I’ll feel the same about today. If you ever reach across time and communicate with yourself, please follow Elizabeth Schott’s example in this poem: be kind. Of course, you don’t need a time machine to be kind to yourself.

notes:
  I often fantasize about time travel and visiting myself earlier in life. While I can imagine how future me will regard past me, I’m far more curious to what past me would think of my current life. The best possible thing that could happen is for both selves to be kind. Luckily, I don’t need a time machine to be kind to myself, and neither do you. This week’s poem demonstrates kindness.

## Poem to Myself at Sixteen

I can see what you want.  
I can see how fiercely you want it.  
I can see that having it will change you  
irreparably.  

I have not come back in time to tell you  
that you may not have it,  
that it should not be yours.  
I have not come back to join that chorus.  

I have come back to stand beside you,  
to fight for your right to choose it.  
I have come back to help you make sure  
it happens all over again.
