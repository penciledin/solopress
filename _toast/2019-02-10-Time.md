  In memory of our beloved Brian Landis, who passed away Friday, February 1 2019. Brian’s photography added such a beautiful visual complement to our poems for this newsletter and for the upcoming *Solo Novo*. He will be missed greatly. *[Gate Gate Paragate Parasam Gate.](http://www.sanghalou.org/oldsitebackup/heart_suttra.htm)*

  Ten years ago I wrote a poem as a twenty-something contemplating the rush of time and what it will mean to grow old. Since then I go back to this topic perennially; I’m obsessed with it.

**Ted Kooser**
## Time

Time is like Fagin in Oliver Twist:  
he has a gang of scoundrel clocks  
and watches, and sends them out  
to pickpocket our lives, but only  
a coin purse or a billfold of minutes  
per outing. You feel a little tug,  
and check your pocket, and find  
to your surprise that another  
day’s gone. When I was young  
I was foolish and carried my life  
right out in the open, a satchel  
full of years, strode blithely smiling  
into the numberless mornings.  
Now I’m old and live on what’s left.  
I keep the precious minutes warm  
in my sweater pockets, clutched  
in my spotted blue hands.
