  How far would I have to drive — and where would I have to search — to truly find myself? What horrors would I find along the way?

**John Amen**
## Lead

I drive a flatbed in Nelson’s Lair,  
looking for marbles, shine, the kind of saw  
you bend into a song over bad coffee  
& a blowtorch. You could call it selective  
memory, the lull of aftermath,  
but there’s a nation of ice  
between me & the free road.  
A Jungian would have a field day w/ this.  
A purist would say *sit still until you disappear*.  
I poured smoke into my throat,  
like giving a murderer my house key,  
I fled downriver, floating in my father’s rafters.  
I begged St. Monica & the stars,  
years lost in the Lower Burrows,  
the hand that plucked me from the thick white line,  
the pipe & chasing glass.  
In the beginning, I learned a safeword,  
it’s taken me a long time to use it.
