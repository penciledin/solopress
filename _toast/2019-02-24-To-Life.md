  My favorite poems connect personal experiences to the universal, and that is just what Jeanie Greensfelder does in this one.

## To Life

On this odyssey called life,  
a new me rises daily  
and takes over. Each  
thinks she is the real deal.  

No going back. I’ve tried.  
I can only imagine my gurgling self,  
one day able to walk, then run, read,  
and wonder. Memories present clues:  

Age six, my two friends, sisters, couldn’t cross  
our street. I could. The big sister yelled at me  
so, I hit the little sister and ran across the street.  
I learned about guilt and loneliness.  

Without guidance, I made my own rules:  
I had to be perfect or suffer.  
The world had to be perfect. If only  
I had devised a better plan.  

Seeking help, I took *Applied Psychology*,  
not knowing the course was about business:  
I learned restaurants with more than one  
cook and waitress have staff problems.  

I didn’t know how to get along with myself  
or with others. My journals recount ongoing angst.  
Over the years, I understood more about my mind,  
yet still puzzle on the mystery of change:  

how the I of me travelled from child to adult,  
who I was yesterday, who I am today,  
and who will show up tomorrow  
on this odyssey called life.
