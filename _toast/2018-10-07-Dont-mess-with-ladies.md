  What I find so brilliant about this week’s poem, by Letizia Coppola of Italy, is the truth is written so simply: Respect others. If you don’t, watch out.

## Don’t mess with ladies
**by Letizia Coppola**

I will compare a woman to a dragon.  
Usually, women love to be treated with   
Respect and appreciation.  

They are very giving and most times, you   
Don’t have to ask for anything.  

They are mothers, they are sisters.  
They are women.  

But don’t mess with them and treat  
Them wrong because then they will change   
Into the dragon, spitting fire everywhere.  

So people, let’s treat a woman like a   
Butterfly in your hands.  
Keep them open and let her fly.
