  Every year, the Fourth of July tends to shift its meaning. CornÂ Goddess has a point\: Despite history and current events, sometimes all I can do is just dance.

## Fourth of July

I clog everyday  
with bluegrass picking or not.  

Sometimes on the roof.  
Sometimes the muddy lot.  

I clog for justice, peace, and ice cream.  

I clog alone but in my mind  
I'm clogging with my sister G.  
and everyone is clapping.
