Every year, the Fourth of July tends to have different meaning for all of us. This poem by Corn Goddess shows that despite history and current events (or maybe because of them), itâ€™s never a bad idea to just keep dancing.

## Fourth of July

I clog everyday
with bluegrass picking or not.

Sometimes on the roof.
Sometimes the muddy lot.

I clog for justice, peace, and ice cream.

I clog alone but in my mind
I'm clogging with my sister G.
and everyone is clapping.
