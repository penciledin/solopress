  If our pets ever develop the gift of language, I hope their poems are as kind as Tom Harrington’s ode to his dear friend, Ginger.

## Talking To My Dog On Way To Taos
**by Tom Harrington**

Ginger, how you hearten me  
with your fast-going-deaf ears  
only catching the loudest pitch of my whistle  
before you race back   
to me atop a stone  
in a mile high pine meadow.  

Time was in the deep wilderness   
you went miles beyond my loudest beckoning  
but to my relief, my joy,  
your canine maps always brought you  
back from chasing after bear or deer.  

Dear girl, let’s remember  
the whistle is our vow to  
keep close now.
