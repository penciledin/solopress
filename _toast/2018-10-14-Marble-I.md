## Marble I
**by Marguerite Costigan**  

*For Crissa*

This stone holds History  
in its worked and human hands,  
coaxed from the vast Amorphous  
by intent, by generations  
of Makers, Sharers, Givers  
with iron and wooden tools, echoing  
the free or cloistered men and women  
who salvaged them  
from the fires, the running waters,  
the palaces, streets, and dusty marketplaces  
long pressed into dust.  
Artisans gently, firmly, with taught  
and intuited patience,  
these men stroke by stroke reveal  
their gods, their heroes,  
their worshiped icons  
from the stone that glows  
with captured inner light.  

Following the crevices, the foliate impurities,  
the traces of lost rivers across  
these yet-unpolished surfaces;  
laying out the tools in rows waiting  
for hands to touch, to press, to heft them  
into use – hands that are evanescent flesh  
chipping away the timeless, the non-evanescent  
with delicate strength, with courage,   
determination  
defying these tongueless surfaces,  
caressing this stubborn paleness  
as they would a Lover –  
stroking, polishing formlessness  
into flesh from stone.
