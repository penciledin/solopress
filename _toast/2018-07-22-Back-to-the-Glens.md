  Many years ago I read a talk that Paul Haller gave about Hospice work. He said “you help others by helping yourself, and you help yourself by helping others.” It was a healing balm for my own Hospice work.  

  In this poem, Paul visits his father with his heart open to losses endured and a clear mind. He offers a window to connect and to heal. Presence at the well of compassion.

notes:
  Paul Haller is Urban Temple Dharma Teacher at San Francisco Zen Center, where he has lived for more than three decades. Ever mindful, as in this poem, he shows us how to come to a place open to what needs to be done here and now. In the face of his father’s great losses and deep inquiry of life, Paul sees the compassionate way forward with clarity — firmly present on the stone floor of the farmhouse kitchen.

## Back to the Glens

He'd lost all his sons except one  
Struck by lightning  
Blown up by a bomb  
Death by cancer  
His slow, thoughtful words —  
You always were a thoughtful boy  
What is this zen?  
Do you think it will spare you having to bear your cross?  
Sitting there, across the table in the   
Stone floored farmhouse kitchen  
I knew why I'd come back to the Glens to talk with him
