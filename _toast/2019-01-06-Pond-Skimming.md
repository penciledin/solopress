  As I attend more and more funerals, it seems impossible to truly memorialize a life. There is no replacement for the lost. I didn’t know the loved one Wendy Burton speaks of here, but if a life can be measured by it’s impact then this is a wonderful account.

## Pond Skimming

*GEN ZAN KYO SHIN  
Mountain source, Abiding Heart*  

Today, so many people whose lives you warmed come,  
that they fill the wooden building to overflow.  
Some stand outside.  

So many people whom you loved in return,  
with your perfect loyal soul and enormous heart.  
Today, as your honest and soaring spirit is celebrated with joy  
in the zendo which you helped build and where we were  
married,  

this one who loves you  
skims the pollen-sprinkled surface of my pond.  

The goop I collect is the vivid green of the Headlands in winter.  
Or, thick brown muck—decaying leaves that unsettle from  
the murky depths and rise to the surface in slow motion.  

When I collect tadpoles by mistake  
I fling them back and watch as they disappear,  
with a flash of white bellies and oversized heads.  

Balanced atop a giant boulder, trying for a certain angle where I  
can scrape the  
fuzz-covered stalks of delicate cattails that die every winter and  
return in the  
spring,  
I hope not to tumble in  
and smile because I know you would smile at my precarious  
perch  
and join me here if you could.
