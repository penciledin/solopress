  The greatest gift I’ve received from parenthood has been an understanding that everything is seasonal: the sorrows and the joys are replaced as time moves on. This week’s poem by Tom Harrington beautifully echoes that sentiment.

## Moving Days
**by Tom Harrington**

Fall leaves pirouette across the patio  
lace ballerinas twirling to the compost.  

The seasons mark days  
to shed what’s gone before  
and embrace what comes after.  

My last seasons will unfurl  
till I mimic the leaves and  
return to earth dancing.
