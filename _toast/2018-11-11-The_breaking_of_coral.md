  Growing up in a California beach town, I feel so intimately connected to this one by Marnie L. Parker. The brilliance of this poem is wrapped in the grimy details, the characterâ€™s inner life honestly reflected in the setting.

## The Breaking of Coral
**by Marnie L. Parker**  

In Long Beach a woman  
clad in black sweater  
and tweed skirt advances  

toward the muddy dock, lights up  
a Lucky Strike as the seaweed air  
wraps around her flame and face.  

The sun sets too early again:  
she breaks skin bumping into corners  
as flecked clay rose paint cracks  

and the volume of scattered women's  
voices sway up and down with the ships.  
She listens closely: Their voices  

scratch like sharp coral beneath.  
Small pieces, once beautiful, begin to break  
toward the crust of the lithosphere.  

She didn't ask for this role: a woman in heels  
and uneven seams, stepping on  
a plank popping out of its grooves.
