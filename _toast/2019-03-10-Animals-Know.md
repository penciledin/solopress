  As an animal lover — and as someone who has experienced the grief of losing a parent — this poem by Michaelann Dimitrijevich strikes me to my core.

## Animals Know

There are always horses on that hill  
but on the day  
we transport my mother home to die  
there is only one—  
white, an apparition,  
and it turns toward us and descends  
with reverent nods  
as we pass.  

Animals know  
Death—  
they are brave and loyal soldiers.  

Like the black cat  
I gave her  
a rescue to save her  
when she became the queen, alone,  
in a king size bed.  
When we moved her from her home  
for more care than we,  
or the cat could provide,  
then the cat mourned  
its empty side of the bed  
and died.  
With a prescience we did not have  
it knew that its mission,  
its secret service was over.  

My mother died yesterday,  
and tonight  
in the light of half a moon  
half of me  
is gone forever.  
Only my tears are whole.  
Our dog hears me weeping  
and comes to sit at my feet.  
Together we contemplate  
the heavens  
and succumb  
to the night birds’  
Requiem.
