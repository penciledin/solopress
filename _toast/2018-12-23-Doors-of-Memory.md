## Doors of Memory

I remember the taste of Emily’s mother’s cassoulet,  
the salt of my lover’s neck, stolen  
raspberries warmed by the sun.  

Some memories begin in scent — *Evening in Paris* —  
my first venture into the wiles of womanhood,   
damp eucalyptus as we walk to school,   
Marrakesh kitchens at dusk as I walk twisting   
medina alleys. And smoke, before flames   
transform the Santa Barbara sunset  
into a roiling Turner canvas.  

Others I struggle to hold — my rotund great-uncle’s arms  
as I reach for Christmas ornaments and  
fling them to the floor shrieking with glee.   
I reach for the moment  
in front of Notre Dame when my eyes catch  
on a young attorney hurrying by and we stand dumb  
until we begin to breathe and speak.  

Memory won’t spare me  
watching the graph of my father’s pulse flatline.  
Or the beautiful collarbone and graceful hands  
of the man who will betray me absolutely,  
Or a stranger’s voice that tells me to be quiet   
if I know what’s good for me.  

Eyes closed, I am given — dawn,   
the circle of Stonehenge at daybreak, long tongues  
of shadow dwarfing the looming stones,   
trees with crowns of the same new red leaves   
I’ve startlingly grown this spring,  

I’m grateful for the rush and renewal  
through all these doors to interior landscapes,   
for the chance to forgive all —  
even myself.
