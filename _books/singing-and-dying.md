## Decoration Day
*By Glenna Luschei*

I too am singing  
and dying. No  
difference.  

As a child, the place I most felt at home:  
my grandparent’s farm unfolded from the prairie.

Mornings, I drank coffee with them,  
cream from the cow.  

Decoration Day I picked peony and iris,  
sold them to families  
traveling to the cemetery.  
Fifty cents a bunch or free to people  
with no cash.  

It was the Depression.  
    *Depression babies  
    Depression glass  
    Fathers walked all night for work.*  
I remember fragrance, lilac most of all.
