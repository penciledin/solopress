Glenna Luschei responds to the death of her husband Bill with a special kind of poetic magic.  The poems in the book remember Bill and project the emotions around his loss like ritual incantations.

*“In Witch Dance, Luschei marries a light touch to penetrating clarity. Poem after poem are easy to read, easy to love, hard to forget.  A highly recommended collection.”*  — Ronald Koertge
