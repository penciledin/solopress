In this collection, Luschei’s poems somehow keep their feet in two worlds at once.  They are constructed of both equal parts of both expressionism and impressionism.  Her special ability is to synthesize the external and internal worlds.

*“Luschei’s juxtaposition of poems in which she travels dreams, and ultimately lives, serve as a reminder that life, for the living, does not stop and should not stop even when it has been flooded with grief.  Given Luschei’s sharp, precise and pointed verse, she is undoubtedly an important voice in contemporary English poetry…”*  — JoSelle Vanderhooft, *The Pedestal Magazine*
