Solo Press has been publishing poetry since 1966.  Its first magazine, *Café Solo*, was released by founder and publisher, Glenna Luschei in 1969.  Since then, Solo has gone on to publish four literary magazine series:  *Café Solo*, *Solo*, *Solo Café*, and *Solo Novo*.

Solo launched the *Solo* journal series in 1996. Jackson Wheeler and David Oliveira anchored the editorial team that produced seven issues across eight years. Poet artists illustrated *Solo* covers for each of the seven-issue series that concluded its run in 2004.

*Solo Café* offered poetry readers annual journals with a variety of themes and formats.  Some journals featured collaboration and others worked as anthologies.  The most recent *Solo Café*, Teachers and Students, was released in late 2010.

*Solo Novo: Wall Scrawls* launched in 2011.  *Solo Novo: 122 Days* was released in July, 2012.

Solo has a history of publishing chapbooks featuring poets who have already published in a Solo journal.  Solo poets should submit a query letter and send a manuscript only on request.
